1-This repository created 20200717 starts with the python 3 script for fam102 for core. Future version will be modified for the sibs.

2-This script works on both the indels for chr21 (allDIVs_chr21.vcf) and the SNPs for chr21 (allSNPs_chr21.vcf)

3- Input and output files are at franklin.dldcc.bcm /home/cpikielny/20200717_py3_test

4- Initial implementation of the pipeline will use 
			-hypothesis/pipeline described for sibs: 20200727 sibs parameters calculated.ezdraw and 20200727 sibs filtration schemes.ezdraw.  Late implementation may use hypothesis/pipeline described for cores.
			-fam102
